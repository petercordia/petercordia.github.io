# petercordia.github.io

This git directory was created by Peter Gerlagh.

I opened this repository to build a website, and to test how certain tools work.

There is currently no license, because I want to maintain the ability to reuse code in any manner I see fit. If someone wants to use any code in this project, if you ask me to I may add some kind of open source license.
